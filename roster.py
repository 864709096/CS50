"""In roster.py, write a program that prints a list of students for a given house in alphabetical order.

Your program should accept the name of a house as a command-line argument.
If the incorrect number of command-line arguments are provided, your program should print an error and exit.
Your program should query the students table in the students.db database for all of the students in the specified house.
Your program should then print out each studentâ€™s full name
and birth year (formatted as, e.g., Harry James Potter, born 1980 or Luna Lovegood, born 1981).
Each student should be printed on their own line.
Students should be ordered by last name. For students with the same last name, they should be ordered by first name.
